/// Configuration seam between an application's settings store
/// and the terminal engine bridge.
///
/// `TerminalBackend.applySettings(_:)` reads through this
/// protocol instead of binding directly to Galaxy's `AppSettings`
/// type, so the engine bridge can ship in a reusable module
/// (`Galactic`) without dragging Galaxy's settings storage along
/// with it. Galaxy's `AppSettings` conforms via empty extension
/// because its property names and types already match this
/// protocol's surface; other host apps would either conform
/// their own settings type, or build a small adapter that maps
/// their settings shape to these members.
///
/// The surface is intentionally minimal — only the values the
/// engine bridge actually reads at `applySettings` time. Per-
/// pane overrides (font-size adjustments, cursor-style
/// subscriptions, etc.) stay on the host app and reach the
/// backend through other `TerminalBackend` protocol members
/// (`setFont`, `applyCursor`, etc.). Settings that vary by
/// pane lifecycle (Session vs Shell) are not on this protocol
/// because the engine bridge treats `applySettings` as
/// pane-agnostic.
///
/// Property names match Galaxy's `AppSettings` shape exactly
/// so the conformance is empty. A future protocol-rename pass
/// (drop the `terminal` prefix; the protocol is already
/// terminal-specific by domain) can happen once Galactic is
/// extracted — the bridge would read clean names and Galaxy's
/// conformance would gain trivial computed properties to map.
/// That refactor is deferred to keep the protocol-introduction
/// commit zero-risk.
