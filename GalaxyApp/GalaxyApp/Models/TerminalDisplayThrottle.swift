/// Coordinates "pause terminal display invalidation"

/// SwiftUI's animation transaction commit doesn't compete
/// with PTY-driven redraw work on the main thread.
///
/// Backend- and chrome-agnostic. The throttle exposes `pause`
/// and publishes `isPaused`. Chrome code (in the host app)
/// calls `pause(for:)` from animation-trigger sites; each
/// backend's implementation (`SwiftTermBackend`, future
/// `LibghosttyBackend`, etc.) subscribes to `$isPaused` from
/// its own init and translates the signal into whatever pause
/// mechanism its rendering layer supports — for SwiftTerm
/// that's a flag on `GalacticSwiftTermView` consulted inside
/// an override of `setNeedsDisplay(_:)`; for libghostty that
/// would be its native invalidation hook. Neither the
/// throttle nor the chrome cares which backend is below the
/// `TerminalBackend` adapter seam.
///
/// Diagnostic log identified the click-to-motion gap getting
/// noticeably worse when a Claude session was actively
/// streaming output. That symptom is main-thread contention
/// between the terminal's per-PTY-chunk `drawRect:` (CoreText
/// layout + glyph rendering) and SwiftUI's animation
/// transaction commit. Both run on main; SwiftUI's commit
/// waits for a free runloop pass; the terminal's
/// invalidations keep that runloop occupied. Pausing
/// invalidation for ~250ms starting at the toggle (slightly
/// longer than the `easeOut(0.15)` slide duration) lets the
/// commit land in its normal slot, and a single catch-up
/// redraw fires when the pause ends.
///
/// Output isn't *lost* — the underlying terminal buffer
/// keeps accumulating PTY data; only the display
/// invalidation is suppressed. When the pause ends, each
/// backend triggers a single catch-up redraw covering its
/// view's full bounds, and the buffer state renders in
/// one pass.
