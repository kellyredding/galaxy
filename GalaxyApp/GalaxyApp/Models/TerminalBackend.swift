/// Abstraction over the PTY + terminal rendering library.
/// Implementations wrap a concrete library (SwiftTerm via
/// `SwiftTermBackend` today; libghostty target in the
/// future). Callers address this protocol, not the library
/// directly.
///
/// The surface is intentionally minimal — just what the
/// Shell pane needs (later phases). Buffer inspection calls
/// beyond `captureScrollbackSnapshot()` (like `getLine`,
/// mouse-mode queries, etc.) are deliberately not on the
/// protocol; adding them would bloat the libghostty swap
/// surface. Extend only when a concrete use appears.
///
/// ## Auto-follow invariants
///
/// Two invariants any conforming backend must uphold so that
/// "viewport stays stuck to the bottom while output streams"
/// works consistently across the chrome:
///
/// 1. **Bottom-stick across size changes.** When the
///    viewport is at the bottom and no user scroll has
///    intervened, the implementation must keep the viewport
///    at the bottom across pixel-size changes (sidebar drag,
///    window resize, font size change). Column changes
///    recompute wrapped lines and can leave the viewport
///    short of the new bottom even without any user intent
///    to scroll up — the resize path is responsible for
///    re-pinning to the bottom.
///
/// 2. **Selection freezes the viewport.** While the user has
///    an active text selection, output must NOT auto-follow.
///    New lines extend the buffer, but the viewport stays
///    anchored so the selected region keeps pointing at the
///    same cells. On selection clear, the implementation
///    re-evaluates the viewport's position relative to the
///    bottom: if still at the bottom, resume auto-follow; if
///    not (output drifted past during the selection), stay
///    frozen — the user is now in implicit scrollback and
///    must scroll back to the bottom themselves to resume
///    auto-follow.
///
/// SwiftTerm implements both via its `userScrolling` flag —
/// active selection sets it true; resize and selection-clear
/// re-evaluate it. A libghostty backend may use a different
/// internal mechanism, but the observable behavior must
/// match.
