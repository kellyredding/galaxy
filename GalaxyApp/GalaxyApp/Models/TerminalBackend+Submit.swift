    /// - **Return submits.** A bare carriage return is the whole job. It needs
    ///   no keyboard protocol, no CSI-u decoding, and cannot be misread as
    ///   text.
    /// - **Return does anything else** — inserts a newline, or is unbound.
    ///   Then a carriage return is useless or actively wrong, and the reserved
    ///   chord goes out instead as a kitty functional key: `CSI 13;16u`, where
    ///   16 is 1 + shift 1 + alt 2 + ctrl 4 + super 8.
    ///
    /// Choosing between them is not a preference. Measured behaviour: the chord
    /// is honoured only while Return is bound to something other than submit.
    /// With `enter: chat:submit` in force it is silently ignored, and a prompt
    /// sent that way sits fully typed and uncommitted. The likeliest reason is
    /// that Claude Code services the carriage return directly in that
    /// configuration and never runs the CSI-u parser for Return at all — but
    /// the mechanism is inference, and the rule is observation.
    ///
    /// Which turns out to be no loss whatsoever, because the two conditions are
    /// exact complements: the chord fails in precisely the case where a
    /// carriage return already submits, and works in every case where it does
    /// not. Do not collapse this back to one instrument. A single one cannot
    /// cover both, and each fails silently — no echo, no error, just a prompt
    /// that never sends.
