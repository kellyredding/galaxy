/// Opaque snapshot of a terminal's scrollback at a point in
/// time. Backends produce concrete implementations from their
/// own internal buffer types; chrome holds the protocol type
/// and iterates cells when it needs to render the snapshot in
/// whatever format the chrome owns (HTML overlay, native NSView,
/// PDF export, etc.).
///
/// The snapshot freezes the buffer state at capture time —
/// subsequent PTY output extends the live buffer without
/// affecting the snapshot. Chrome can iterate the same snapshot
/// multiple times (e.g. re-render on theme or font change)
/// without re-capturing.
///
/// This protocol is the chrome-facing seam; concrete impls
/// (e.g. `SwiftTermScrollbackSnapshot` in `SwiftTermBackend`)
/// own backend-typed fields privately and translate to the
/// engine-agnostic `ScrollbackCell` representation during
/// iteration. When a future libghostty backend lands, it gets
/// its own snapshot impl reading from Ghostty's buffer types —
/// chrome doesn't change.
///
/// Rendering format choice lives in chrome. The protocol's
/// surface is intentionally limited to data accessors — no
/// `render(...) -> String` because the output format is a
/// chrome concern, not an engine concern.
