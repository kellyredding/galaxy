    /// ESC[3J (erase scrollback) — applied directly to the emulator
    /// buffer with nothing sent to the child. That drops the scrollback
    /// and blanks the screen, but the prompt is content the child owns,
    /// so a form feed (Ctrl+L, 0x0C) is then sent out to make the child
    /// reflow its viewport onto the clean screen. In a full-screen TUI
    /// (Claude Code) that reflow repaints the current view, so the net
    /// effect is a trimmed scrollback with the live screen intact; in a
    /// plain shell it lands as a cleared screen with a fresh prompt. A
