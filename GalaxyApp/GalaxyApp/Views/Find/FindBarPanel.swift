/// Borderless `NSPanel` that hosts the find bar in a separate
/// window from the parent surface.
///
/// **Why a panel and not an inline overlay?** AppKit's
/// `NSAutoFillHeuristicController` queues a synchronous
/// password-autofill check whenever a text field becomes first
/// responder. The check walks the entire window's keyboard focus
/// loop, recursing through the SwiftUI hierarchy and performing
/// `AnyHashable.==` comparisons at every node. With Galaxy's
/// per-session view fan-out, that walk takes 2–3 seconds on
/// first Cmd+F per session — pinned via thread sampling to
/// `_NSComputeFirstKeyViewVisuallyInDirection` traversing tens
/// of thousands of SwiftUI views.
///
/// Hosting the find bar in its own panel scopes the heuristic's
/// walk to the panel's view tree, which contains only the find
/// bar's three buttons and the text field — about five focusable
/// views total. The heuristic still fires, but its walk completes
/// in single-digit milliseconds. This is the same pattern Apple
/// uses for `NSTextFinder` and the find UIs in Safari, Pages,
/// and Xcode.
///
/// The panel is non-activating and floats above the parent
/// window as a child window, so it tracks parent moves
/// automatically. Resizes are handled by re-anchoring on
/// `windowDidResize` notifications.
