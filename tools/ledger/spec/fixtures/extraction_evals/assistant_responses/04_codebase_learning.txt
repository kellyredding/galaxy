I've analyzed the codebase structure. The application follows a clean architecture pattern:

- All business logic is encapsulated in Interactions (app/interactions/)
- Jobs use a specific pattern with input, on_perform, and logged_params methods
- Database queries use distribute_reads for read-only operations to hit replicas
- The API follows RESTful conventions with versioned endpoints (/api/v1/)

The authentication flow is interesting - it uses a custom middleware that injects the current user into the request context, making it available to all downstream handlers without explicitly passing it.
