I've implemented JWT authentication for the API. I chose JWT over session-based authentication because:

1. The API is stateless and needs to scale horizontally
2. Mobile clients will be consuming this API
3. We need to support token refresh for long-lived sessions

I set the token expiry to 15 minutes with a separate refresh token that lasts 7 days. The refresh token is stored in an httpOnly cookie for security.
